# The Go Programming Language

> By Alan Donovan

- [Book's Website](http://www.gopl.io/)
- [Book's example code](https://github.com/adonovan/gopl.io/)

This is the personal end of chapter exercises repo for Aaron Imbrock implemented in Go 1.14.

This repo was forked from [adonovan/gopl.io](https://github.com/adonovan/gopl.io/). Added to it are my personal implementations of the end of chapter exercises found in the book. There's no affilition of my work to that of the author.

You can download, build, and run the programs with the following commands:

    $ export GOPATH=$HOME/gobook            # choose workspace directory
    $ go get gopl.io/ch1/helloworld         # fetch, build, install
    $ $GOPATH/bin/helloworld                # run
    Hello, Aaron
